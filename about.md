<p>
  I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Civil Engineering from University of British Columbia. I am presently working as a Junior Design Engineer (EIT) in the telecommunication industry. In the past few months, I have been learning about Machine Learning and exploring its potential applications in Civil Engineering. I hope to use this platform to document my learning journey and share helpful tips that I come across.
